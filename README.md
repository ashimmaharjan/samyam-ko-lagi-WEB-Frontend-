# Frontend code architecture

Provide a brief description of your front end code architecture including folder structure, API consumption, etc.

The front end part was coded with the help of HTML (HyperText Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), jQuery and JavaScript. All of the HTML files are in the root directory itself while the othe elements are kept in their respective folders. Al CSS files are in the 'css' and 'style' folder, Images used all across are kept in 'images' folder and so on. To run the web-application, we must run the 'index.html' file and all other activies can be followed accordingly.

All of the files here are related with the front-end part only. It has its own backend server build using MongoDB and Node js.

For the interaction of front-end with the API, jQuery (AJAX) has been used. Here is a sample of one interaction:
